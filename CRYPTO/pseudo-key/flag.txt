the key is made after doubling the index and mod 26

the key character can have candidates like,
	if we reached an "i" in the pseudo-key, we may have an e (4) or r(17) in the original key. 

generating all key combinations with the bit mapping, and decrypting the ciphertext, we can get the flag.

i guess, actually Keys are not always as they seem...

key: redpwwwnctf 
plaintext: i_guess_pseudo_keys_are_pseudo_secure

flag: flag{i_guess_pseudo_keys_are_pseudo_secure}
